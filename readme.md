# A full page wireframe

## The Mission

A client needs a new website for her services. The designer you are collaborating with sent you a wireframe\*. Your task is to turn this wireframe into an interactive HTML page so that the client can get a good idea if she likes the current structure or not.

Make sure that on tablet and on mobile the layout still works (for example, columns stack on top of each other, etc).

\* A **wireframe** is a schematic representation of the layout and structure of the page. It usually looks all grey. It is used to get approval on the structure, before proceeding with the real design.

## Instructions

1. Choose a framework. For this exercise it's better to start with a _component-first_ framework such as Bootstrap or Bulma, rather than a _utility-first_ framework such as Tailwind.
2. Using _exclusively_ the classes provided by your framework, try to get as close as possible to the layout provided. Don't write any custom CSS.
3. Deploy on the system of your choice (GitHub Pages)

_Please note: the look and feel of the page will obviously be different. It will match the standard style of the framework of your choice. That's OK!_

### Extra time?

If you used a _component-first_ framework, do the same exercise but with a _utility-first_ framework. And viceversa.
